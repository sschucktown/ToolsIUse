# ToolsIUse
[Brackets](http://brackets.io)
This is currently my favorite text editor as I have been doing a fair amount of front end dev.  

[Smartmockups](http://smartmockups.com/)
This is a tool I use to post mockups for websites and Android applications.  It is easy to past your url in the site and get a mockup in return.

[MockFlow](https://designcloud.mockflow.com)
A very easy and free tool to put together wireframes and mockups for pc and smartphones.
